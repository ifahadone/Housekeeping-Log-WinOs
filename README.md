- Make sure your `C:\Apps\Logs\` already has logs in it.
- if no sample logs, run `tester.ps1` to simulate logs as follows,
    - it will create dummy logs file and
    - it will also override `created date` backward so that can test `1`, `60` days old files
- Run the `LogManager.ps1` as `Administrator`
